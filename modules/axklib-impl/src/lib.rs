//! Platform implementation of the `axklib::Klib` trait.
//!
//! This crate provides the platform-side glue that implements the small set
//! of kernel helper functions defined in `axklib`. The implementation is
//! intentionally minimal: it forwards memory mapping requests to `axmm`,
//! delegates timing to `axhal`, and wires IRQ operations to `axhal` when the
//! `irq` feature is enabled.
//!
//! The implementation uses the `impl_trait!` helper to generate the FFI
//! shims expected by consumers. Documentation here focuses on the behavior
//! and expectations of each exported function.
